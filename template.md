### Design draft format

Before you start Luther work, you should be able to complete the following form for your project. However, keep in mind that throughout the design iterations of your project, many parts of it will likely change (i.e. increase/decrease in number of movies, types of characteristics, etc), so this is just a starting point.

Please submit this plan via Slack.

- Minimum 1000 rows (movies, players, teams, etc.)
- Minimum 10 features (type of movie, gross revenue, etc.)

#### Question/need:
Project 2: Predicting how many yards per game will an NFL Running Back (RB) and Wide Receiver (WR) have and equating that to Fantasy Football Points.

 Target Variables for MVP
 - RB: Carries/Game and Yards/Carry
 - WR: Receptions/Game and Yards/Reception
 - Other potential variables (if time permits)
    - Quarterback (QB): Completions/Game and Yards/Completion
    - Tight End (TE): Receptions/Game and Yards/Reception
    - Defenses: Yards, carries, receptions, completions allowed per game
    - Touchdowns (TD): TDs by QB, RB, WR, and TE and TDs allowed by Defenses

Methodology
- Analyze data from 2019 season for MVP (analyze previous seasons if time permits)
- Test Case: Current Season

Target Audience
- Fantasy Football Enthusiasts
